= Ntxt =

  Ntxt is a simple plain-text note file. This website is a simple parser
  and view placed on top of that file format.

  Most data retrieval is done through tags and full-text searching.
  There is some support for Wiki-like syntax, specifically
  honoring the = title = syntax and we will automatically convert things
  starting with http or https into links like this:
  http://www.google.com

== Controls ==

  o Double click to collapse a box.
  o Start a line with a [tagName] to tag that blocks as having that tag name.
  o Control-Click a block to highlight it.
  o Notice the search in the lower-left. Search is case sensitive and, no, 
    we don't stem words.

  o Got feed back? Send it, but remember that this is supposed to be a 
    view-only with few, but powerful, features..
  o Enjoy!
