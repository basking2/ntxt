<h1>About Ntxt</h1>

<p><i>A tool to view n.txt formatted notes files.</i></p>

<p>Ntxt is a reference to my <code>n.txt</code> file. In that file are notes
in plain text. There are some wiki-like conventions to give it structure and
help guide my reading and assist in searching or grepping for information.</p>

<p>There is no way to edit the <code>n.txt</code> file through ntxt.html. 
It's just here as a display tool.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The "About" link links to this page.</li>
  <li>The "Top" and "End" links link to the top and end of the page.</li>
  <li>The "Toggle All" link collapses or expands all the text blocks.</li>
  <li>Finally, the search drop-down controls what will be filtered (tags or 
      all text) when the search box is typed in.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Formatting Rules</h1>
<h2>Headers</h2>

<p>Header lines look like something you would see out of a wiki.</p>

<pre>
  = Header 1 =
  == Header 2 ==
  = Another Header 1 =
</pre>
  
<p>Header 1 is the largest and highest header. All text after it, aside from
another 1-header, will be considered a sub-block. In the example 
"Header 1" and "Another Header 1" are the two top-level blocks. "Header 2" is
a child of "Header 1".</p>

<h2>Indentation</h2>

<p>Indentation also forms blocks.</p>

<pre>
  = Header 1 =
  == Header 2 ==
    Sub block of header 2.
      Sub block of the preceding line.
    Another block below header 2.
  = Another Header 1 =
</pre>

<p>In the above example Header 2 has 1 sub-block because there is an indentation
of 2-spaces with an intermediate indentation of 4-spaces. That 4-space line
is bundled into a subblock to the 2-space indented block of text.
</p>

<p>The only ways to break out of this 2-indent text is to:</p>

<ol>
<li> Put in an empty line. That is, a line with no indenting. A line with only
     two spaces on it will be seen as a continuation of the 2-indent block.</li>
<li> Indent more shallowly, such as a 1-space line.</li>
<li> Put in a header.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tags</h2>

<p>Lines beginning with [tag1] [tag2] (ignoring whitespace) are considered to 
have tags <code>tag1</code> and <code>tag2</code>. For example:</p>

<pre>
  Block1
  [block 1 tag] [example]
  
  [this is tag] Block2 [not a tag]
  [block 2 tag] [example]
</pre>
  
<p>Notice, tag names may have spaces. Both blocks are tagged with 
<code>example</code>.  And finally, <code>not a tag</code> is, well, 
not a tag. It does not start a line.</p>

<p>Also note that you can't tag header blocks directly because the header line
must start with = and tag lines must begin with [. Blocks inherit all their 
child blocks' tags, though, so finding header blocks by tags is still possible.
</p>
