1.0.8
  - Adding block edit capabilities.
  - Normalized long options to not use equal signs.
  - Editor takes optional value of program to edit document with.
  - Renamed test files to tc_*.rb and bundling into ts_all.rb.
  - Updated unit tests to match new block parsing.
  - Unit testing using gem 'test-unit' for now.
  - Bug Fix: Do not inherit the parent block's indentation. The parser will do
    that work.
1.0.7
  - Bug Fix: Close blocks when appropriate.
1.0.6
  - Tags are now any string that appears on 1 line surrounded by [].
  - Improved help text.
  - Parser rewrite. Much simpler code.
  - Support for Markdown style headers.
1.0.5
  - Tag printing now prints the entire block of text that a tag is
    associated with. Previously text of sub-blocks  and text
    separated by sub-block text was not printed.
  - Internal change. Tags applied to blocks start counting at 0.
    This allows an easy method to determine if a tag in an Ntxt::Block
    is of a child node (tags[tag]>0) or is associated
    with only that node (tags.member?(tag) && tags[tag]==0).
  - Added two other methods to print blocks of text found by searching 
    tags. Leaf and parent. Parent prints the entire parent node (if
    on exists). Leaf prints only the block of text that has the tag 
    on it, no parent text snippets.
1.0.4
  - Fixed description.
1.0.3
  - Bug Fix. Lines preceeded with equals signs (=) caused an infinite loop
    unless matched with the trailing equals sign to create header.
1.0.2
  - Added -e/--edit flags to ntxt command.
