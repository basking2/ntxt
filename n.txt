== The Beginning of a Digital Notebook ==

Suggested by another developer:
1. A plain text file.
2. Date at the top, proceed down.
3. Open problems for me:
3.1. I want a wiki syntax of some sort to conver this to html.
3.2. I would like this to break up into sections, but it's unclear to me the
     best way to do that. For now, "h1" tags denoted by = text = will be
     enough.

== Notes Ideas ==
[design]

This is a simple markup for this file. Some ideas to make this more mine-able.

The headers denote blocks that end at the EOF or when a higher header is
encountered.

Tags are denoted by [word] or [word1,word2] beginning a line. The tag
applies to the block it is in, the words that follow on the line, or the
following paragraph of text.

Eventually we would like to have a query system that can search for:
  1. Blocks by tag.
  2. Paragraphs by tag.
  3. Lines by tag.
  4. Regular plain-text search of blocks.
  
Perhaps we should stop the design here before it gets too complicated.

[todo] [p1][p2] [Date: Now] Better tagging rules. 
[todo] Indented text is also a block?

  Completed Javascript parser for this small wiki-ish format.
  Planning a ruby command-line version of this for mining larger documents
  and possibly producing HTML output.
